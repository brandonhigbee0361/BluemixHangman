like a rolling stone
i cant get no satisfaction
imagine
good vibrations
johnny b goode
hey jude
one
i Say a little prayer
in the ghetto
hotel california
yesterday
stairway to heaven
come Together
stand by your man
dont go breaking my heart
tonights the night
free bird
comfortably numb
all along the watchtower
november rain
crazy train
crossroads
over the rainbow
as time goes by
singing in the rain
moon river
white christmas
mrs robinson
when you with upon a star
the way we were
stayin alive
the sound of music
he stopped loving her today
ring of fire
your cheatin heart
friends in low places
i fall to pieces
glaveston
behind closed doors
cruise
blowin in the wind
if i had a hammer
where have all the flowers gone
back in black
early morning rain
Whole lotta love
